#Need rpart for this.
#Because rpart has some default parameters that prevent our tree from growing,
#we must override these parameters by specifying minsplit and minbucket.
#Minsplit is “the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order 
#for a split to be attempted” and minbucket is “the minimum number of observations 
#in any terminal node”.
#Internally, rpart keeps track of something called the complexity of a tree. 
# The complexity measure is a combination of the size of a tree and the ability of the 
#tree to separate the classes of the target variable. If the next best split in growing 
#a tree does not reduce the tree’s overall complexity by a certain amount, 
#rpart will terminate the growing process. 

#Setting cp to a negative amount ensures that the tree will be fully grown.

#When rpart grows a tree it performs 10-fold cross validation on the data.

#elements in the iteration relative to the fraction of mislabeled elements in the root. 
#The cross validation error rates and standard deviations are displayed in the 
#columns xerror and xstd respectively.
